# Policy Comparison Enhancement Plan

## Executive Summary
Transform the policy comparison experience from a multi-step process into a seamless, one-click analysis that deeply integrates with health profiles to provide instant, personalized insurance recommendations.

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points
1. **Multi-Step Friction**: Users must click through 3 steps (Configure → Retrieve Pricing → Run Analysis)
2. **Disconnected Health Data**: Health profile data isn't fully leveraged in initial analysis
3. **Manual Configuration**: Users manually adjust expected healthcare usage despite having detailed profiles
4. **Delayed Gratification**: Results require multiple interactions before seeing value
5. **Limited Intelligence**: System doesn't proactively suggest optimal policies based on health conditions

### Strengths to Build Upon
- Comprehensive health profile system with utilization predictions
- Robust cost calculation engine
- Detailed policy analysis capabilities
- Member-specific breakdowns
- Treatment plan generation
