# Insurance Cost Analysis Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the enhancement of health insurance policy analysis to provide more intuitive cost comparisons based on detailed health profiles and real-world treatment costs.

## Core Principles
1. **Health Profile First**: Users must complete detailed health profiles before analysis
